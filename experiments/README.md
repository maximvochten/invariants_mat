## Application to a demonstrated 3D contour following task

The framework is applied for a human-demonstrated 3D contour following task where both the motion and contact force of the tool in contact with the contour are recorded. The invariant properties of the descriptors under different calibrations, experimental setups and artificial transformations are verified.

For the analysis with screw invariant descriptors, run `contourfollowing_screw_invariants`.

For the analysis with vector invariant descriptors, run `contourfollowing_vector_invariants`.
